## MULTICORE ##

2 ARM CPUs, can both be running independently -> CS 213.
Shared memory places in two RAM FIFO buffers between the cores,
Core0->Core1 and Core0<-Core1, data is pushed and popped between the two.
Interrupt system alerts cores that there is data in the FIFO.
Core reads/writes to RAM, sends a flag to the other core to access the data safely
stored in RAM by the other. Not so necessary for a little microcontroller.
