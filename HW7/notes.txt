## I2C OLED DISPLAY ##

Need to ask Marchuk if I need the Pico 2. If so need to solder it.. Fuck..
Need to solder the OLED display too.

128 pixels, x32 -> 4096 pixel bits. Copy the three files to same depth as the .c file,
and in CMake add_executable, need to add the files (.c extensions), also add the .h to the top of the .c

ASCII number is the first index of the font function. Constant x, down y,
move over, loop through every letter, call the update function.
Positive y is down. Null character at the end of character array (value 0, NULL character).
For pixels on, is a one.
