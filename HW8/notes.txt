## PWM, RC SERVOS, ADDRESSABLE LEDS ##

Motor has a built-in low-pass filter. Some kind of input to PWM, i.e. Pico internal clock.
Every two consecutive pins share the same timer, so same frequency.
Can have different duty cycles though. Need to set up counter (for roll-over) and set
the duty cycle and frequency, and the Pico will maintain the same waves...

Specify the pin for PWM, assign it to that slice, take the clock which is 150Mhz, take a divider
(like 3), so 150Mhz/3/1kHz frequency = 50,000 (counter value). Has to be smaller than 65,000 (16 bit counter).
Minimize divisor to maximize resolution. #include hardware_pwm...

Going to control RC servo motors using PWM to tell it an angle (instead of speed). Fire.
Servo explanation... You did all this research for Argonne.

VBUS is raw 5V.

HOMEWORK

Ok so passing another color immediately sets the color of the LED
next on the chain. The reset time is more than 50uS, micro-seconds?

First need to set the LEDS all off once powered.

One LED needs to go through 360 colors in 5 seconds.
So 72 colors per second.
