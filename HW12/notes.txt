## CAMERA ##

In addition to grabbing the OV7670, grab a wire with a female/male end to attach to the camera 
and into the breadboard. Looks like a lot of wires? Like a grouping or header.

Communication in parallel port, 8 bits simultaneously. There is also a cap to remove from the camera I think..
Using a ribbon cable with all the colors, connected and stuff. Ignore PWDN pin, or just ground it.
RESET pin to high? Datasheet says it has an internal pull down resistor, and a value of 1 resets all the pin values,
so should that be a button?

Read the first X PLK, ignore the last 20... Use PWM on Pico to generate internal clock (MCLK).
Just wire up the camera and run the given code. Do we have to code anything?

It's on I2C1, not 0, pins 14 and 15. Check the .c file for the pin numbers, can change them but probably don't.
I guess everything is already in the code and NIck is just explaining how this works. Kinda awesome about the IMU stuff seeing as 
we are having to modify the coursework waiting for this stuff. Send a letter in Putty to take a picture.

init_camera is the hard part. God bless Nick.

Going to use Python to collect the data and plot it. Nick gives two python files.
Gotta figure out how to do the serial port stuff. Second version uses Pygame0.
